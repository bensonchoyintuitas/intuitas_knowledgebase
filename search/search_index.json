Table of Contents Key concepts Domain Subdomain Domain-Centric Design Data Mesh Domain Topology Data Fabric Data Mesh vs Fabric Reference topologies Hybrid federated mesh topology Enterprise Data Platform Reference Architecture Enterprise (Logical) Data Warehouse Reference Architecture Enterprise Information and Data Architecture Enterprise Metadata Architecture Databricks Unity Catalog Metastore Enterprise Security Key concepts The following key concepts are used throughout this knowledgebase. Domain Domains relate to functional and organisational boundaries, and represent closely related areas of responsibility and focus. Each domain encapsulates functional responsibilities, services, processes, information, expertise, and governance. Domains serve their own objectives while also offering products and services of value to other domains and the broader enterprise. Our use of this term draws inspiration from Domain-Driven Design and Data Mesh principles. see Domain driven design Subdomain A subdomain is a lower-level domain within a parent domain that groups data and capability related to a specific business or function area. Domain-Centric Design Using domains as logical governance boundaries helps ensure data ownership and accountability. This approach aligns with the data mesh principle of decentralizing data management and providing domain teams with autonomy. Data Mesh A data mesh is a decentralized approach to data management that empowers domain teams to own their data and build data products. The then shares data as products with other domains. It emphasizes autonomy, flexibility, and interoperability. This approach is not necessarily appropriate for all organisations. It can be described through 4 principles which organisations will embody with varying degrees of maturity and success: - Data as a Product : Data is treated as a valuable asset that can be bought, sold, and managed like any other product. - Self-Serve Data Consumers : Data consumers have the autonomy to access and use data without relying on IT support. - Data as a Service : Data is delivered as a service, allowing for flexible and scalable access to data. - Domain-Driven Governance : Data is governed by domain experts, ensuring alignment with business objectives and data quality. see Data Mesh: Principles Domain Topology A Domain Topology is a representation of how domains are structured, positioned in the enterprise, and how they interact with each other. see Data Mesh: Topologies and domain granularity Data Fabric A data fabric is a unified platform that integrates data from various sources and provides a single source of truth. It enables data sharing and collaboration across domains and supports data mesh principles. Data Mesh vs Fabric A data mesh and fabric are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they can be complementary approaches. A data mesh can be built on top of a data fabric. Reference topologies Organisations need to consider the current and target topology that best reflects their strategy, capabilities, structure and operating/service model. The arrangement of domains: reflects its operating model defines expectations on how data+products are shared, built, managed and governed impacts accessibility, costs, support and overall experience. Source: Data Mesh: Topologies and domain granularity Hybrid federated mesh topology Hybrid of Data Fabric and Data Mesh: - Combines centralised governance with domain-specific autonomy. - Offers a unified platform for seamless data integration, alongside domain-driven flexibility. Fabric-Like Features: - Scalable, unified platform: Connects diverse data sources across the organisation. - Shared infrastructure and standards: Ensures consistency, interoperability, and trusted data. - Streamlined access: Simplifies workflows and reduces friction for data usage and insights delivery. Mesh-Like Features: - Domain-driven autonomy: Empowers teams to create tailored solutions for their specific data and AI needs. - Collaboration-focused: Teams act as both data producers and consumers, fostering reuse and efficiency. - Federated governance: Ensures standards while allowing teams to manage their data locally. Hybrid federated mesh topology reflects a common scenario whereby centralisation occurs upstream for improved consolidation and standardisation around engineering, while federation occurs downstream for improved analytical flexibility and responsiveness. Centralising engineering Centralizing engineering tasks related to source data processing allows for specialized teams to efficiently manage data ingestion, quality checks, and initial transformations. This specialization ensures consistency and reliability across the organization. Distributed Local engineering Maintaining a local bronze layer for non-enterprise-distributed data enables domains to handle their specific raw data requirements, supporting use cases that are not yet enterprise-wide. Cross-Domain Access Allowing domains to access gold data from other domains and, where appropriate, silver or bronze, facilitates reuse, cross-domain analytics and collaboration, ensuring data mesh interoperability. Enterprise Data Platform Reference Architecture Describes the logical components (including infrastructure, applications and common services) that make up a default data and analytics solution, offered and supported by the enterprise. This artefact can then be used as the basis of developing domain-specific overlays. Example: Enterprise (Logical) Data Warehouse Reference Architecture Logical Data Warehouse topology Reflects the domain topology. Provides unified access to data warehouse products from across domains via a common catalog. Example: Enterprise Information and Data Architecture Solutions such as data warehouses and marts should reflect the business semantics relating to the scope of requirements, and will also need to consider: - Existing enterprise information, conceptual and logical models - Legacy warehouse models - Domain information models and glossaries - Domain business objects and process models - Common entities and synonyms (which may form the basis of conformed dimensions) - Data standards Other secondary considerations: - Source system data models - Industry models - Integration models Enterprise Metadata Architecture Description of applicable metadata standards Enterprise Metadata Architecture and Metamodel Description of metadata governance, stewards and processes Databricks Unity Catalog Metastore Only one metastore exists per region Documentation Metastore-level storage accounts are used to store the metastore and its associated data. Recommendation: Databricks recommends that you assign managed storage at the catalog level for logical data isolation, with metastore-level and schema-level as options. Catalog layouts Metastore admin is optional - all cases, the metastore admin role should be assigned to a group instead of an individual. The enterprise domain topology has a direct bearing on UC catalog layout and design.

(See Enterprise Data Platform Reference Architecture ) Example reference architecture: Business architecture Business processes Business processes are the activities and tasks that are performed to achieve the goals of the business. Understanding them is necessary to understand: - the context in which data is captured and used - concepts and entities that are relevant to the domain - the relationships between different processes and data Business glossary A business glossary is a list of terms and definitions that are relevant to the business. see Domain Glossary. Business metrics Metrics are the measurements of the performance of the business processes. They should be documented according to a defined template that captures, at a minimum, the following: - name - definition - formula (with reference to data elements and definitions in the business glossary) - dimensions - source(s) - metric owner - frequency Infrastructure This section is a work in progress Environments, Workspaces and Storage This diagram illustrates a data lakehouse architecture with the following components and flow: Data Sources Data originates from multiple sources such as: - Databases - Kafka or event streaming - APIs or Python scripts - SharePoint (or similar sources) Enterprise Engineering Layer Centralized enterprise workspaces are managed here with multiple environments. While work can be achieved within a single workspace and lakehouse storage account, decoupling the workspaces and storage accounts allow for more isolated change at the infrastructure level - in line with engineering requirements: Each workspace contains: Data from prod catalogs can be shared to other domains. Domain-Specific Layer Each domain (e.g., business units or specific applications) operates independently within a single workspace that houses multiple environments. PROD , TEST , and DEV storage containers within a single lakehouse storage account for domain-specific data management. Local Bronze for domain-specific engineering of domain-local data (not managed by enterprise engineering) Data from prod catalogs can be shared to other domains. Data Catalog A centralized data catalog (unity catalog) serves as a metadata repository for the entire architecture: Enables discovery and governance of data. Optional external catalog storage. Secrets This section is a work in progress - Management - Areas of use Storage Lakehouse storage Lakehouse data for all environments and layers, by default, share a single storage account with LRS or GRS redundancy.

See Bounded context Domain glossary Expand on the enterprise glossary and add domain specific terms and definitions. In cases where domain definitions are synonymous with enterprise definitions, the enterprise glossary should be referenced. In cases where definitions are conflicting, governance should be applied to resolve the conflict. Domain data and warehouse models Domain-level data and warehouse models reflect domain-specific scope, requirements and semantics as expressed in models and glossaries. Conformed dimensions may serve as a bridge between domains for common entities. Data Architecture Data layers and stages Data and analytics pipelines flow through data layers and stages. Conventions vary across organisations, however the following is an effective approach: Top level layers follow the Medallion architecture . Within each layer, data is transformed through a series of stages. Metadata Contains metadata that supports engineering and governance. This will vary depending on engineering and governance toolsets Bronze The Bronze layer stores raw, immutable data as it is ingested from source systems. (Persistent) Landing Initial storage area for raw data from source systems. Stores raw events as JSON or CDC/tabular change records. Data is maintained in a primarily raw format, with the possibility of adding extra fields that might be useful later, such as for identifying duplicates. These fields could include the source file name and the load date. Partitioned by load date (YYYY/MM/DD/HH) Raw data preserved in original format Append-only immitable data. Schema changes tracked but not enforced ODS (Operational Data Store) Current state of source system data with latest changes applied. Maintains latest version of each record Supports merge operations for change data capture (CDC) Preserves source system relationships PDS (Persistent Data Store) Historical storage of all changes over time. Append-only for all changes Supports point-in-time analysis Configurable retention periods As these may be available in landing - may be realised through views over landing Silver The Silver layer is source centric and focuses on transforming raw data into cleaned, enriched, and validated datasets. Base Models Representation of source data with no changes. Used as a foundation for staging models as well as data quality checks. Staging Models Source-system and object centric transformations that are core to all downstream consumption. Examples of transformations: 01_renamed_and_typed 02_deduped 03_cleaned 04_filtered/split 05_column_selected 06_business_validated 07_desensitised Enrichment Models Still source-centric, however: - more complex business logic and transformations are applied e.g. common calculations and derivations. - may combine multiple staging objects from the same source By separating enrichment from core staging, we can schedule these processes independently. This allows for flexibility in updating or refreshing only the parts of the data pipeline that need it, reducing unnecessary computation and improving efficiency. It also allows for change and versioning of those business rules with minimal impact on core staging objects. Source Reference Data For convenience, reference data specific to the source can be segregated here and aligned to standards and downstream needs. Raw Vault Data vault 2.0 aligned raw data warehouse. Gold The Gold layer focuses on business-ready datasets, aggregations, and reporting structures. Business Vault Data vault 2.0 aligned business data warehouse where business rules and transformations are applied. Intermediate Models These act as building blocks for marts, transforming and aggregating data further. Then be thought of as mart staging https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/3-intermediate Business-specific transformations such as: Pivoting Aggregation Joining Funnel creation Conformance Desensitization Enterprise Reference Data Reference data, independent of source can be aggregated here for broad consumption. Marts - Facts and dimensions Kimball style marts that represent business entities and processes. They may serve foundational or narrow requirements. be scoped to specific systems or conformed across the enterprise Marts - Denormalised Single table / view objects that combine data from multiple objects (e.g. facts and dimensions) Lakehouse Catalog to Storage Mapping Unity catalog objects (catalogs, schemas, objects) are mapped to: - Storage accounts - Environments (containers: dev, test, prod) - Layers (Level 1 folders: dev.bronze, dev.silver, dev.gold, etc) - Stages (Level 2 folders: dev.bronze\\landing, dev.bronze\\ods, dev.silver\\base, dev.silver\\staging etc) Example: Data Engineering Ingestion This section is a work in progress Improved diagrams and assessments of: lakeflow streaming: kafka -> landing -> databricks autoloader -> ods streaming: kafka -> iceberg assessed in terms of: cost performance resilience maintainability governance CDC patterns sql-server (ct tables, datatyping via views, custom init vs change sources and handling) Ingestion is the process of acquiring data from external sources and landing it in the platform landing layer. It should be: - Scalable, Resilient, Maintainable, Governed - Pattern-based, automated and Metadata-driven where possible - Batch and stream-based Example batch ingestion options: Pattern specific notes: built and working - PAttern 1: streaming: kafka -> landing -> databricks autoloader -> ods - see repo Bronze Landing to ODS Project built and working - Pattern 2: batch: source -> adf -> landing -> databricks autoloader merge to ods - see repo Bronze landing SQL Server to ODS Project - adf requires azure sql and on-premise integration runtime built and working - Pattern 3: batch: source -> databricks lakehouse federation -> databricks workflows -> ods, pds - see repo External Database to ODS Project - requires network access to source i.e. poor mans datalake. todo - Pattern 4: batch/streaming: source -> custom python -> deltalake -> external table Sharepoint ingestion - Pattern 5: sharepoint -> fivetran -> databricks sql warehouse (ods) - see repo fivetran Rejected patterns: - batch: adf -> deltalake -> ods (does not support unity catalog, requires target tables to be pre-initialised) - batch: adf -> databricks sql endpoint -> ods (no linked service for databricks) - batch: adf + databricks notebook -> landing, ods, pds (more undesireable coupling of adf and databricks an associated risks) Transformation This section is a work in progress Batch and Micro-batch SQL transformation dbt see dbt standards Streaming SQL transformation This section is a work in progress Non SQL transformation This section is a work in progress Data sharing and delivery patterns Row Level Security see Row Level Security Pull / direct access Databricks Delta sharing practices dynamic views to be tested Databricks Delta Sharing allows read-only access directly to data (table, view, change feed) in the lakehouse storage account. This allows for the use of the data in external tools such as BI tools, ETL tools, etc. without the need to use a databricks cluster / sql endpoint. -Permissions: Delta sharing is a feature of Databricks Unity Catalog that requires enablement and authorised user/group permissions for the feature as well as the shared object. Costs: In Delta Sharing, the cost of compute is generally borne by the data consumer, not the data provider. Other costs include storage API calls and data transfer. Naming standards and conventions see naming standards Tightly scope the share as per the principal of least privilege: Share only the necessary data Single purpose, single recipient Granular access control Set an expiry Use audit logging to track access and usage sql SELECT * FROM system.access.audit WHERE action_name LIKE 'deltaSharing%' ORDER BY event_time DESC LIMIT 100; Limitations: No Row Level Security and Masking support (dynamic views required) Reference:https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/08/01/security-best-practices-for-delta-sharing.html ADLSGen2 access to data ADLSGen2 access, while technically possible, is not recommended as it bypasses the unity catalog and associated governance and observability. Given Delta Sharing, then direct ADLS file sharing is usually unnecessary. However, there are still a few edge cases where ADLS file sharing might be preferable, even when Delta Sharing is available: Unstructured data Large non delta-file transfer Consumers that dont support delta-sharing Duckdb access to data (via Unity Catalog) Duckdb is a popular open source SQL engine that can be used to access data in the lakehouse. Duckdb can be run on a local machine or in process in a databricks cluster. Costs: Duckdb data access will incur costs of the underlying compute, storage access, data transfer etc as per delta sharing.
