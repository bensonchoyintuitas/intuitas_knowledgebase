# Enterprise Data Intelligence Blueprint

This blueprint consists of a collection of resources that describe Intuitas' approach to designing and delivering Data, AI and Governance solutions. 

It distills insights from our R&D, answers to common questions, and lessons learned from real-world experience.

The ideas are intentionally opinionated, shaped by the Intuitas design philosophy, and proven in practiceâ€”supported by working demonstration environments. While grounded in large, multi-domain enterprise deployments, they can be adapted to suit organisations of any scale or type.


## Important Notes

**Living resource** - This content is continuously updated and refined through ongoing R&D, lessons learned, and feature evaluations. Some sections may remain unpolished as they evolve.

**Currency** â€“ Positions and guidance reflect the product landscape and functionality available in general release at the time of writing. While every effort is made to maintain accuracy and update information promptly as features evolve, no guarantee of timeliness is provided. Readers are encouraged to independently validate all claims.

# Overview

This comprehensive blueprint provides practical guidance for designing and delivering enterprise-scale Data, AI, and Governance solutions. It uses 

**What you'll find here:**
- Real-world tested architecture patterns
- Opinionated design principles based on proven practices  
- Step-by-step implementation guidance
- Working demo environments and examples

Built from extensive R&D, customer engagements, lessons learned and benchmarks.


## Design Principles

Our approach is guided by nine foundational principles that ensure transparency in decision-making, effective trade-off evaluation, and strategic alignment. 

Organisations should consider these principles alongside any existing frameworks that matter most to their context.


| # | Principle | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| **1** | **Think big, start small** | Balance rapid delivery with strategic positioning. Deliver value iteratively. Ensure investments deliver sustained benefits without creating technical debt. |
| **2** | **Empowered Autonomy** | Enable domain experts to manage data independently while leveraging shared, scalable foundations. |
| **3** | **Disciplined Core, Flexible Edge** | Federated governance model that ensures policy consistency while enabling rapid, domain-specific delivery. |
| **4** | **Actionable Data** | Real-time, comprehensive data extraction (structured & unstructured) with platforms ready for immediate insights and AI/ML. |
| **5** | **Make It Easy to Do the Right Thing** | Provide automation and platforms that guide users toward secure, policy-aligned practices effortlessly. |
| **6** | **Cost Transparency and Efficiency** | Transparent cost models with pay-for-value usage while promoting reuse and removing sharing barriers. |
| **7** | **Adaptability for Growth** | Platforms that seamlessly adapt to evolving business needs, data growth, and diverse workloads. |
| **8** | **Interoperability and Inclusion** | Smooth integration across cloud, on-premises, and diverse technology stacks (bring-your-own). |
| **9** | **Flexibility Through Standards** | Technology-agnostic, standards-based components that maintain flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in. |

# Getting Started

### **Choose Your Starting Point**

| Role | Recommended Path | Focus Areas |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Leaders & Architects** | **Levels 0-1** | Strategic alignment, enterprise patterns, governance frameworks |
| **Domain & Technical Teams** | **Level 2** | Practical implementation within established enterprise frameworks |

### **Iterative Approach**

An iterative approach means each level builds upon the previous but can be revisited and refined as capabilities mature.

1. **Level 0: Context Setting** - Define organisational objectives, domain structures, and strategic goals
2. **Level 1: Enterprise Architecture** - Apply enterprise-wide patterns and reference topologies  
3. **Level 2: Domain Solutions** - Implement domain-specific solutions using enterprise patterns
4. **Standards & Conventions** - Apply consistent naming and conventions throughout
